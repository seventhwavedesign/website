•   Learning through doing</strong></p>

<h3>Radical Waves</h3>
<p>Talk Action draws alternative ideas from the world of activism, social justice movement and intentional communities. We believe in ideas as ‘Radical Waves’ that slowly permeate mainstream assumptions, cultures and power structures. </p>
<h3>Talk Action’s philosophy</h3>
<p>1.Challenge hierarchical structures</p>
<p>2.The ‘way you teach’ as much as ‘what you teach’ either challenges or supports the existing hegemony.</p>
<h3>How we work</h3>
<p>Community projects and training sessions are delivered using participatory methods.</p>
<p>Co-design, Co-creation, Co-delivery…</p>
<p>Our Facilitators show by example how to work in a non-hierarchical way. There is of course the imparting of knowledge and experience but delivered in a way that challenges the notion of ‘expert’ and top down teaching methods.<br />
We hope this approach will then filter down and empower communities.</p>
<h3>Training delivery style preferred:<img width="372" src="/assets/user/images/img_5606_r.jpg" alt="pic" height="279" class="right" id="blocks-image-271"/></h3>
<p>•   Interactive<br />
•   Dynamic agendas<br />
•   Participant Led<br />
•   Experiential</p>
<p>Sessions are jam packed with exercises, group &amp; experiential learning – you definitely won’t be staring at powerpoint all day!</p>
<h3>Where we came from</h3>
<p>Founded by Jonathan Elliott in 2006, Talk Action has become a collective of expert facilitators, researchers, community event artists and programme specialists. </p>
<p>By initially setting up an online directory of services, Talk Action has now flourished into a whole larger than its parts delivering training, community projects &amp; events across London, the UK, and Ireland.</p>
<p>"Educational movement, guided by passion and principle, to help students develop consciousness of freedom, recognize authoritarian tendencies, and connect knowledge to power and the ability to take constructive action." Giroux, H. (2010) "Lessons From Paulo Freire"</p>
