 Talk Action has just completed a series of workshops training local unemployed residents in events management, culminating in 5 fantastic community events in Islington. The main focus of the project was to improve the lives of the most vulnerable ‘hard-to-reach’ community members by increasing their confidence, providing them with new skills, and inspiring them to create positive change within their communities. The project is in partnership with St.Luke’s Community Centre with funding from the Big Lottery.</p>
<p><em>'The Course is wonderful!'<br />
'Very satisfying, rewarding and a great sense of achievement.'<br />
'Thank you so much - learnt loads and my confidence has definitely gone up.'</em></p>
<p>We piloted the project in 2011-12 and participants delivered this amazing festival with over 1000 people!:  </p>

<p><strong>In 2015 we worked with 10 local residents in North London to deliver a community arts festival - <a href="http://www.fizzfest.co.uk">www.fizzfest.co.uk</a>. </strong></p>
<p>Participants get the opportunity to develop new skills and experience the creation of a large scale event over several months. The volunteers do everything from marketing, stage managing, running art workshops to developing the creative content of the festival.</p>
<p>The event is almost entirely programmed with local musicians, artists, poets, and dancers. If you'd like to perform or have a stall at the event please do get touch.</p>

<h2>Engaging Diverse Communities (University of the Arts) 2012</h2>
<p>Talk Action worked with 30 Student Halls Social Reps on event management skills and to help them engage with marginalised student residents. The Reps developed their own social activities that looked at inclusiveness regarding  accessibility, race, religion, cultural and ethnic diversity, gender and sexuality. Participants also set-out plans to work with local residents, community groups and charities to improve relationships with students living within the community.</p>
<h2>Community Performance stage at  The Havering Show 2012</h2>
<p>The show attracts over 40,000 people over the bank holiday weekend and Talk Action gives local amateur and young performers the opportunity to perform at a major London festival. The project also brought local youth classical music students together to perform with members of the London Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<h2>Community Development - Finsbury Arts Festival &amp; Event Management Training (2011-12)</h2>
<p>In 2011/2012 Talk Action ran a series of workshops training young people and community members in events management, culminating in the Finsbury arts and music festival in Islington. The main focus of the project was to improve the lives of the most vulnerable ‘hard-to-reach’ young people and community members by increasing their confidence, providing them with new skills, and inspiring them to create positive change within their communities. The project was in partnership with St.Luke’s Community Centre steering group (25 people of mixed age, race and ethnicity), with funding from Awards for All.</p>

<h2>Friends of the Earth 'Power Up' (2010 &amp; 2011)</h2>
<p>Talk Action worked with Friends of the Earth on their ‘Power Up’ events in 2010 &amp; 2011. This residential training weekend increased the legal capacity of local residents to influence decisions affecting their communities.</p>
<h2>Defra ‘Climate Challenge’ project (2009)</h2>
<p>We ran a project to train young people to communicate climate change at Respect and Rise Festivals to over 70,000 people!<br />
Participants learnt communication techniques and developed their very own ideas that were put in to practice at the outdoor events. Their activities included a hydrogen powered cinema; video booth that filmed people dancing in 'I'm hot enough - cool the climate' t-shirts and footage was then shown on the main stage screens; Climate Medics to give advice; a giant mural and various costumes and quizzes.</p>

<p><strong><br />
There is no such thing as a neutral education process. Education either functions as an instrument which is used to facilitate the integration of generations into the logic of the present system and bring about conformity to it, or it becomes the ‘practice of freedom’, the means by which men and women deal critically with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world.</strong></p>
